in a single server soon).
### Dependencies
* `classnames`
* `react`
* `react-router`

* `jquery` (to be removed)

Detailed instructions for development environment will follow

## To-Do
* *Migrating to single-server setup*
* Styling
* Better handling of text entry (especially for markdown)
* Tabs/labeled group chats/etc
    * *probably store comments client side for starters, lose them after each session*
