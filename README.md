Collaborative, markdown-enabled chat in the browser, built with React.

## Getting Started
Requires `node` (and `npm`).
To run, `npm install` and then `node server.js` and `npm start` (will combine `express` and `react-router`
in a single server soon).
### Dependencies
* `classnames`
* `express` (api endpoints)
* `remarkable` (automatic markdown for comments)
* `react`
* `react-router`
* `react-dom`
* `jquery` (to maybe be removed)
* `react-bootstrap` for styling and layout
* `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting

Detailed instructions for development environment will follow

## To-Do
###Near Future:
-----
* TravisCI or some other automatic testing for pull requests
* *Migrating to single-server setup* -- (just need to integrate express.js server)

###Roadmap:
------
cleanup / initial viable release.
